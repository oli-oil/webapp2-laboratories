In any case, when a software engineer initiates a project, it is important to consider the project estimation itself. In this case, the project started in January 2024, and June 1st is the expected launch date; this kind of thing does not always work as smoothly as expected (in some cases, because of some inevitable circumstances); therefore, it can be considered an “unrealistic” estimation for such an ambitious project. Well, it is possible to achieve this if the software engineers ensured that the project was divided into smaller achievable tasks first, solved every task, and then combined the solution for each to come up with a cohesive conceptual solution for the overall project. If this is not the case, the software engineers can consider setting an appropriate time frame for this by using Project Management Tools and Communication and Collaboration tools. 

Some of the best Project Management Tools being utilized in this field are Trello, Microsoft Project, Adobe Workfront, etc.… These tools were initially developed to assist and micro-manage every workflow a software engineer (or any professional) would do, and they are a great help if properly utilized as they will provide a visual aid for prioritization and proactive tracking of the project. Communication is key for a successful project; hence, a tool is also needed that will become an avenue for information dissemination and idea distribution for project members. Zoom, GSuite, and Microsoft Teams are examples of Communication and Collaboration tools. 

Implementing these things might help the company achieve the project's expected launch date and establish a more efficient software development process throughout the project.
